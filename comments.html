                                called to check on my nephew a few days later & I think that shows how honorable this
                                office really is. Thank You for your incredible service!</p>

                            <p>Just visited him in his new office in Arlington, TX with my newborn. In the hospital we
                                saw a different doctor and immediately we could compare and he is 200% better, he spent
                                more than 1 hour examining baby and educating us about newborn care, when to worry, when
                                to call back, how to prevent..</p>

                            <p>You have to be truly blessed & lucky to receive treatment from Dr Sirikonda.A man with
                                abundant knowledge & love, highly professional, patient oriented & a great care
                                provider. Half of your pain vanishes with his hospitality & other half he will take care
                                like nobody else. Who ever is reading this review, consider yourself lucky as your baby
                                is going to be in safe hands for sure, just trust Dr Sirikonda blindly& go for his
                                service. This is from my personal experience I’m writing this review.. our daughter was
                                under his care while he was at NJ& we really really miss him as we have not found any
                                pediatrician even close to him after he shifted. Even after 1yr after he shifted his
                                practice, we remember him almost everyday for his great service & of course miss him
                                each time our baby is sick.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Sirikonda is a awesome Doctor who enjoys his craft. I rarely write reviews but I am
                                compelled to do so. He saw my little one today and my son gave him a hug at the end….The
                                front staff was awesome, as my son was seen right away. First class all the way!!</p>

                                find Dr. Sirikonda. He always goes above and beyond to help us and always follows with a
                                phone call next day to see how my children are. His patient relations and bedside
                                manners are impeccable. I would highly recommend Dr Sirikonda to anyone out there.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Sirikonda has been my children's pediatrician since the day they were born. He is
                                extremely kind, loving, and knowledgeable. He is very thorough whether it may be a sick
                                visit or an annual check up. He makes himself available to answer any and all
                                questions/concerns you may have. I am saddened that he has left the New Jersey area, but
                                I am sure that he will continue to serve other families the same way he did with mine

                                takes great care of children at his clinic and at Hackensack Medical Center. He was my
                                kids doctor since they were born. I am so lucky that my doctor had recommended him for
                                my first baby to be released from hospital after she was born. Since then he has been
                                pediatrician for all my kids. Every visit to his office was soothing and calmly. He gave
                                the best recommendations and care in regards to my children's</p>

                            <p>I honestly never had a time to rate a Doctor at all, I have never given ratings to my

                                pediatrician. Here I am on Google because my kids love Dr. Sirikonda, a friendly
                                professional doctor that I wish every
                                doctor was as same as him. Bring your kids to Dr. Sirikonda folks, I have 6 kids, we
                                love the environment and his
                                experience is by far the best, trust me. This is where your children be taken to, a real
                                doctor, not a new nursing
                                practitioner.</p>

                                down to any of us. He is thorough
                                and knowledgeable (and kind). He provides all the current western medicine with
                                additional eastern medicinal knowledge
                                and advice as we desire. The only potential negative comment would be that his office
                                hours are not clearly available.</p>

                                do whatever it takes to make
                                sure our kids are at ease and comfortable. Dr. P.S also take plenty of time to answer
                                any questions we may have. I never
                                feel rushed, and always feel confident in their care of our kids. I highly recommend Dr.

                            <p>We’ve been seeing Dr. Sirikonda since our boy was a newborn. One day his elbow joint was
                                dislocated while playing so we
                                rushed down the street to our pediatrician to see if he could recommend us to an ER. He
                                saw our baby on the spot and
                                popped his elbow right back into socket. We didn’t have to wait hours in a pediatric ER
                                somewhere and we are so
                                grateful.</p>

                                though it’s been more than 1yr
                                for now!! We just can’t forget him.he was more like an Angel for my daughter. Took care
                                of our every
                                concern,educates&emotionally supported us each time we broke down with concern for our
